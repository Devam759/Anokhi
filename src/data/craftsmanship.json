      "description": "Hand Block Carving is the first stage in the development of printed textiles. It lays the foundation for any hand printing, and therefore also underlies the basis of any later handicraft work incorporated in printed pieces, such as tassels or embroidery, making it an especially fundamental craft.",
      "process": "Wooden blocks are first planed and sanded for a smooth finish then whitened with a chalk paste to allow for tracing of the design. Working without the aid of any electrical machinery, carvers only use traditional hand tools, so intricate blocks such as this can take six days or longer to complete.",

      "description": "Gold & silver printing is an embellishment frequently used on traditional Indian fabric. Originally artisans painted or printed a pattern with 'roghan' gum paste then applied 'varak' gold or silver leaf, however few artisans still practice this method of application.",
      "process": "Today gold & silver printing requires the use of a brass tube with a stenciled base & metal plunger. The plunger is filled with paste & depressed, forcing a measured amount through the stencil onto the fabric. Using a muslin pouch, metallic powder is then dusted over the cloth to coat the design.",
